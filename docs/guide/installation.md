# Installation

## Requirements

**Server (production):**
- PHP 8.2 or later (with `json`, `mbstring`, `fileinfo` extensions)
- A web server (Apache, Nginx, Caddy)

**Development machine:**
- Node.js 24 LTS, pinned in `.nvmrc` (only needed for local development and builds)
- PHP 8.2+ for local development and backend tests

The PHP `zip` extension enables ZIP backups, restore, and release installation. GD enables image thumbnails and responsive variants.

## Deployment

### Install a release

Download the built ZIP from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/GetCometCMS/CometCMS/releases/latest), extract it, and upload its contents to your server. Include hidden files such as `.htaccess` and `.user.ini`. Continue with the web-server configuration below. No local build is needed for a release ZIP.

### 1. Build from source (optional)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GetCometCMS/CometCMS.git
cd CometCMS
nvm use
npm ci
```

### 2. Build a deployment package

```bash
make build
```

This compiles the Vue admin frontend and assembles everything into a `dist/` folder. The output is a self-contained PHP application — no Node.js is needed on the server.

### 3. Upload to your server

Upload the **contents** of `dist/` to your server's web root (or a subdirectory). The structure will look like:

```
index.php
router.php
app/
config/
admin/        ← compiled Vue frontend
storage/      ← empty, writable directory for content/users/etc.
```

### 4. Configure your web server

Application requests must be routed through `index.php`. Block direct access to `app/`, `config/`, and `storage/`; the included Apache configuration already does this. Serve the compiled admin assets normally.

**Apache** (`.htaccess` is included in the build):
```apache
Options -Indexes
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^(app|config|storage)(/|$) - [F,L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^ index.php [QSA,L]
```

**Nginx:**
```nginx
location ~ ^/(app|config|storage)(/|$) {
    deny all;
}

location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
}
```

### 5. Ensure `storage/` is writable

Grant the PHP process write access to `storage/` using the ownership and permissions supported by your host. A mode of `755` is sufficient only when PHP runs as the directory owner. Release installation also needs write access to the application files it replaces.

### 6. Open the admin

Navigate to `https://yourdomain.com/admin`. The first-run setup screen will appear.

## Configuration (optional)

`config/config.php` lets you adjust:
- `app.timezone` — default `UTC`
- `content.max_revisions` — revision snapshots kept per entry, default `55`
- `site.max_revisions` — revision snapshots kept per website layout, region, component or theme, default `55`
- `cache.ttl` — API cache TTL in seconds
- `security.login_throttle` — brute-force protection limits
- `updates.repository_url` — GitHub repository used by the admin update page
- `updates.require_checksum` — require a `.sha256` release asset before installing
- `updates.preserved_paths` — paths skipped when installing release ZIPs
- `webhooks` — fallback outbound webhook configuration; the admin saves changes in `storage/settings.json`

The URL is **auto-detected** from the HTTP request — no `base_url` setting is needed.

Open the admin update page from **Administration → Updates** in the sidebar, or choose **Version** in the account menu.
Update checks use GitHub releases. Updates are downloaded and verified first,
then installed from the staged package. Installing an update replaces
release-owned application files while preserving the configured paths, including
`storage/` for content, content types, media, users, revisions and other local
data.

CometCMS supports public GitHub releases for update checks and downloads.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
make dev
```

This starts the PHP built-in server and the Vite dev server simultaneously. The admin is available at `http://localhost:8000/admin`.
